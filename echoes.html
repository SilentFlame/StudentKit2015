		<h3>B.Tech in Civil Engineering with M.S. by Research in Building Science<br><br> Batch of 2013</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			IIIT Hyderabad introduced its Building Science program for undergraduate students in 2013 for the first time, making it amongst the first colleges in India to offer a course of this nature. I came to the decision of joining IIIT after a lot of inhibitions, which one is bound to have before joining a course being offered for the first time. Till date, I can proudly say that I have never regretted my decision. Be it in the field of Computer Science or Civil Engineering, we were offered the best of courses that will help us succeed in this technology-oriented world.
		</p><p> 
			IIIT was my first “adventure” away from home. And after spending two years here, I have indeed managed to make it my second home. Not only in the field of academics which the college is known for, the college offers a lot of other opportunities in extra-curricular areas as well, be it dance, music, sports, etc. – all of which help an individual to build his or her personality. The best part about IIIT is that it gives a lot of power to the student body, to organize these events and be a part in its decision making. 
			I have experienced some of the best moments of my life in IIIT and I hope that there are many more to come in the next 3 years.

		<p>What does college offer you? An academic environment, an experienced and competent set of esteemed faculty, a respectable degree and placements that ensure a nice paying job. Well here comes the surprise, that's not all, not even close to what IIIT offers you. The first thing that I realised when I joined  college is, nothing can be achieved here if you believe in being spoon fed. You love something, you will get enough inspiration and help to get motivated, pursue it and in the end conquer it.</p> 
		<p>College life is like a clean slate, a fresh start where you make friends with your peers, seniors and even professors. You get to partake in  world class research undergoing in different and diverse labs, try different things that you never imagined you could (imagine finding out your ability to sing after performing impromptu in front of a full fledged audience!), find your passion and experience a plethora of unforgettable memories  that will define your personality, your outlook and basically you. The academic workload is challenging, but there are enough activities and events that you can indulge yourself in, to strike a perfect balance between academic proficiency and personality development. Time management and keeping up your energy levels will make sure you do experience everything in adequate and right amounts.</p>
		<p>EHD offers a perfect blend for me to toggle between studying various computer science aspects and connect to the roots of our rich past with a novel motive to merge both of them to discover something unique and useful for mankind. As a student, one has ample freedom and opportunities to take part in any sport, cultural or co curricular activity or in some cases, to even start a new club of your own. College life at IIIT is pretty good. It's a close knit community where everyone knows almost everyone. You can rediscover yourself by leaving your inhibitions and apprehensions behind and be rather pleasantly surprised with what the college will transform you to, and it surely will be a memorable and important aspect of your life. Be enthusiastic, take chances, make your own decisions, step outside your comfort zone, learn new things, feel passionate and excel!

		<p>Dear first years, welcome to IIIT! When I joined IIIT as a DASA student two years ago, college was a new, very different, confusing, frightening experience. Biggest reason being that there was nobody to tell me what to do. But then I realised two things. the first was that now I had the freedom to take control of my life in whichever way I wanted. The second was that everyone else in my batch must be going through the same experience. So, don’t hold back. Explore the plethora of opportunities available. Make friends with your batchmates and seniors. They’re going to be your best friends and companions for the next few years, at least.</p>
		<p>After the initial confusion and fear, I began to realise that that IIIT is a seriously awesome place. You know that “common first year” - filled with complex Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology and other things - that other colleges have? You’re not going to have that here. In a couple of days, I dived straight into the fields of Computer Science and Electronics, giving me every opportunity to learn stuff that most people had to wait an entire year to learn.</p>
		<p>College has been an amazing experience for me the past two years, and if there’s one thing I’ve discovered about this place, it’s that if I try hard enough, I can grow to become pretty much whoever I want to be. In these last two years, I’ve been given opportunities in the Student Academic Council, the Constitution Drafting Committee and also, Felicity, the college’s techno-cultural festival. (I’m one of the three coordinators for next year’s fest and I sincerely hope you guys will help us make next year’s Felicity mindblowing!) The opportunities are virtually limitless and there aren’t really any boundaries. So go on. Learn. Meet new people. Make friends. Have fun. Trust me, you have a fun four years ahead of you.</p>
		<p>P. S. I sincerely suggest you read the post “50 Things” on the MIT admissions blog. No, you’re not getting any links. Google and find out. Googling is going to be one of the most useful skills you can develop in college.</p>

		<p>I am Mohit Jain, a 4th year CSD student at IIIT-H working in CVIT lab. Yes, a lot of abbreviations in a relatively small sentence. You can call them the tags you will start earning as you progress through your life in the IIIT family. I entered IIIT-H with nearly no exposure to research in computer science and had Physical Education as my fifth subject in +2, so basically my knowledge of computer science was very limited but that never turned out to be a problem - thanks to the curriculum here which never assumes that you know how to code. The research departments here cater to a wide variety of fields in computer science like Computer Vision, Data Sciences, Networks and Security, etc and have well equipped labs and faculty mentors to guide you through your work. I chose CVIT (the computer vision lab) in my 3rd year and have been working on challenging tasks ever since. Apart from the academics, the house-culture here is something I really liked as it gives you ample opportunity to show your talents in the fields of dance, music, drama, literature, sports. If you have a gift outside these categories, go ahead and start a club of your own! In the very first year itself! Lack of opportunity is something you will never ever come across whilst your stay at IIIT. So keep adding these tags to your name and get ready to enter the best period of your life, college! I'll see you around!</p>

			<br>
		<p>CND at IIIT-H aims to train students in a niche domain of computer science's application.
		The idea is to use computer science in certain domains of theoretical scientific research
		broadly, these areas include interactions of biomolecules by studying their dynamics, studying techniques of studying these dynamics, genomics/proteomics and other prominent branches of bioinformatics, RNA bioinformatics, systems biology, quantum information theory, nanoparticle synthesis and cognitive neurosciences, which is still nascent. The program requires students to study a slightly modified course structure but allows them to take nearly all courses that CSE students take. Courses specific to the program help align interest and build foundation.</p>
		<p>My experience in this program has been like that in any other scenario, with both highs and lows. It is a rigorous program and requires a lot of hard work. Science can't be studied without a lot or rigorous theoretic understanding. Professors here are more than one can ask for with all of them having decorated scientific careers. However, be warned that the program isn't a substitute for a regular CSE program. The 'N' makes a monumental difference in the aims of the program.</p>

		<p>It all began when the gates to IIT crashed and I, who did not know any other college, 
		started looking out desperately. After a few google searches, I somehow concluded that
		IIIT Hyderabad would be a decent option. One of the key points that struck me, was the emphasis on the research culture. I was not very interested in computer science so electronics was the option I went with. I, being someone who always wanted to do things not mainstream, filled in ECD as my first preference, as it seemed like a fair choice. Now after three years that flew past like cool breeze, I think of IIIT as a place which brought out the various good, bad and ugly aspects of my life. I am proud of and not-so-proud of many things that I have done. Even so, more than anything else, I have cherishable experiences in my college life. From being the class representative to the felicity coordinator, from struggling with assignments to pulling off all-nighters before exams, from great entrepreneurial ideas to my event management start-up, these three years have been incredibly interesting, to say the least. This college provides a platform to identify your dreams and pursue them. Amidst the hectic academics, you will be given enough opportunity to learn things that are equally important to your life. Make sure you strive to pursue your interests and acquire new ones. Make sure you meet seniors bond with them and gain from their experience.
		Coming to the branch ECD, it is a unique branch, which blends an engineering degree 
		beautifully with research. The college has great research labs for robotics, image 
		processing, chip design, communication and various other interesting aspects of 
		electronics.</p> 
		<p>I believe college is a place where you go with your instincts, do what you love, find who 
		you are, prove what you are made of and finally leave as a much better person in 
		comparison to the one who you entered as. I welcome you to the IIIT family and look forward to meeting you!</p>

		<p>I was admitted to IIITH through the DASA mode of admission. Through the difficult times of waiting for counselling results, IIIT's acceptance letter came like a huge relief - without second thought I cancelled all other admission processes and joined IIIT-H! And I was not disappointed. I too started off with the student kit in hand, reading the experiences of my seniors, and then proceeded to make memories of my own. Here I have been able to fully appreciate the cultural diversity, the amazing opportunities, and the personal growth this place has brought within me. With the opportunities here, an introvert like me began actively participating in cultural performances,  trying out sports, taking up positions of responsibility, participating in the organization of a fest, heading up the college magazine and even speaking in Hindi. Everything we feel we give up for academics in high school, we have the opportunity to try them out in college!</p>
		<p>Academically I feel energized and challenged when I interact with so many  bright minds. In terms of guidance I have my professors and seniors, with whom we can interact with on a one-on-one basis thanks to the smaller batch sizes . My branch is ECE and we are indeed a close knit group. The intensive workload coupled with the ongoing events in campus life have really made me work as much as I play as we juggle multiple things at once. The freedom to work wherever and whenever I want to (no curfew as a girl!) is something I value highly and it speaks a lot about the institute in terms of letting us pursue our interests. IIITH also encourages, other than research, a strong social responsibility and conviction to follow your dreams.</p>
		<p>Overall I have had an amazing experience at college, because I believe it was a good fit for me. I am often asked by freshers and aspiring students whether being a DASA student has ever given me trouble, socially or academically. I would have to give a strong no-- I have never been made to feel like a "DASA student" here, as I have the same hostel and classes as everyone else, compete on the same level, have plenty of non-DASA friends who have never treated me differently. After you are here, it is not the mode of admission that is important, but the fit of the college to your personality - any sincere, interested and grounded student can do well.</p>

		<p>Hello, freshman! </p>
		<p>Let me tell you what this write-up is not about. It doesn’t tell you where IIIT students go after graduating, or what the college culture is like, or what all you would do as a student. Instead, let me tell you what my four years here have been like, so that you can visualize a possible path of your journey at IIIT. </p>
		<p>My first year of college came with the sweet taste of freedom, with occasional days of introspection in the midst of the never-ending assignments. The second year, on the other hand, was an emotional ride, where I was no longer treated like a child but expected to take responsibility, and where the assignments caused many sleepless nights and deadlines whooshed past every single day. The third year brought with it a super-power of balancing work and play, whereas the fourth year reminded me almost everyday that this journey was nearing its end, which meant it was time to give everything I had to my work and friends.</p>
		<p>IIIT worked well for me because it first taught me to dream and then it taught me that I could work hard enough to achieve those dreams. It taught me how to learn. It taught me how to convert a hostel wing into my family - in fact, an entire batch into my family. It taught me to be free. This is a place where I made lifelong friendships that helped me make it happily through fast-paced workload. 
		Come here with an open mind and a free soul, and you will not leave disappointed. There will always be people to talk to, questions to ask, passions to pursue, sights to see and doors to unlock. Welcome Freshman, and may the force forever be with you!</p>
