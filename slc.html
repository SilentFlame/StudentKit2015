Moderators from our volunteer team will try their best to clarify your doubts, or direct your queries to the appropriate authorities.</p>

		<h3>A Special Note to Parents:</h3>
		<p>I take this opportunity to draw the attention of all parents towards an important activity, indicated in the tentative orientation schedule. On 3rd Aug we plan to have a day-long ‘Discussion with Parents’. At IIIT-H, we believe that education is not only about academics but also about providing essential guidance to the ‘young adults’ in finding their real goals and evolve into responsible members of the society. Both parents as well as teachers can play important roles in this regard and hence during this meet, we would like to explore ways and means by which this can be achieved. We therefore expect parents to join us on the Parent’s Day and participate in the discussions. Those accompanying their wards should plan to spend a couple of extra days, and join us on Parent’s Day. </p>

		<p>For boarding during this period, we have provided you with a list of hotels near IIIT Hyderabad.</p>

		<h4>Thanking You</h4>
		<h4>With Best Regards</h4>
		<h4>Dr. Dipti Misra Sharma</h4>
