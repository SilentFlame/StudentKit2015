		<h2>Dear Reader</h2>	
		<br>		
		<p>It’s over. It’s past. Those pesky entrance exams and interviews are behind you, and the next chapter awaits. Whatever happened, put it in a tiny box and throw it away. You don’t need it anymore. You have arrived, and IIIT Hyderabad welcomes you.</p>
								
		<p>Each of you come here hopeful. Each with your own expectations from life. Maybe it’s to be the next big thing, or to learn as much as you can, or maybe just to do the best you can and see where it lands you. Either way, the years that you spend here will be the best and worst years of your life. This is your starting line. How will you fare? Well, that’s up to you.</p>
								
		<p>Yes, it might sound terrifying. New place, new people, no family, a stranger to share your room with, more responsibility and freedom than you’ve ever had being thrust upon you, when not even six months ago, you probably had to ask permission to go to the restroom. Plus, it probably doesn’t help when you think about graduation, placements and all those troublesome, tension-infusing exploits. Basically, you’ll have your fair share of awkward, nerve-wracking experiences.</p>
								
		<p>But they don't even begin to outweigh the positive. IIIT-H is, first and foremost, a tight knit family. Owing to its relatively small size, you know everyone by name, and you get to bond with juniors and seniors alike. You get more opportunities to excel. Whether it’s academic things like doing well in a course, doing research work, competitive coding or exciting internships, or other important things like playing sports, writing for the college magazine, dancing for the fest, creating your own band and performing in November Jam, and so many other cultural activities. You get to explore talents that you never knew you had, and find something that you are really passionate about.</p>
								
		<p>Now, stop worrying about what your parents say, what your friends say and what aunty and uncle say, everything is up to you from this day on. Make decisions wisely. No one else but you can decide your future. It’s up to you and the effort you put in. Make sure to get a piece of everything college has to offer, don’t hold back. Enjoy these years as much as you can. There is nothing like them.</p>
								
		<p>To help you through this daunting process, the institute has constituted a Mentoring system, which enables student mentors to assist the freshmen in overcoming any hurdles that they might be experiencing in finding their bearings in college. We have an Apex body of students who, in conjunction with their Faculty guides, will be coordinating with your direct mentors. Your mentors and us, the Apex Body are always available for you to contact with any issues throughout the year. If there is anything we can help you or your parents with, it would be our pleasure to do so, just as our seniors did for us. Our phone numbers are given below to get in touch with us at any point of time.</p>
